# Python Refresher with Simulated Healthcare Data
A Python fundamentals refresher using simulated healthcare datasets to demonstrate core programming concepts, data analysis, and visualization techniques.

## What You'll Learn
- **Python Fundamentals**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, file handling
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas filtering, grouping, sorting, and statistical analysis
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Real-world Application**: BMI calculation and healthcare data analysis

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Dataset Features
The simulated patient dataset includes:
- Patient name
- Weight (pounds) and height (inches)
- Age and medical condition
- Calculated BMI and health categories

## Getting Started
